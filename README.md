# 42_Mastery_Computerv1
42 Mastery Computerv1 Project, using Rust


Make file was done just for evaluator purposes, should be omitable.

Usage:

make.

and then

./target/release/computor1 "equation in correct format"

example input:
./target/release/computor1 "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"


example output:
Reduced form: 4 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 0 
Polynomial degree: 2
Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are: 
0.905239
-0.475131
